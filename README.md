## Objectives
By the end of this experiment, you should be able to:
* write a basic System Verilog specification for a memory component
* pre-load the memory with known contents stored in an initialization file
* design a signal generator by combining a counter with a ROM component
* change the frequency of the signal with rotary encoder on Vbuddy
* generate two sinusoidal signals simultaneously with different phases using dual-port ROM
* capture and store a audio signal using the microphone on Vbuddy and a RAM component
* read and write to a RAM component simultaneously
* use parameterisation to generalise designs for different address or data widths

## Task 1 - Simple sinewave generator

A sinewave was observed, although it took some time because I have a smooth brain and didn't copy something correctly.

### _Test-yourself Challenge_ 

Modified the design so that **_vbdValue()_** function is used to chage the frequency of the sinewave generated. The higher **_vbdValue()_** is, the higher the frequency of the sinewave becomes.

## Task 2 - Sine and Cosine Dual wave generation
